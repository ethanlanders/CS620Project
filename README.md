### **Walkability and Well-Being: An Urban Analysis**

### Description
This project explores the relationship between community walkability and various aspects of well-being in urban environments. Focusing on New York City, the study aims to discern correlations between walkable communities and happiness indicators, such as mental health, poverty rates, and access to healthcare. The research is ongoing, aiming to uncover patterns that suggest how walkable environments might contribute to increased happiness and well-being.
